    <h2>What is french toast</h2>
    <p>This fabulous French toast recipe works with many types of bread â€” white, whole wheat, brioche, cinnamon-raisin, Italian, or French! Delicious served hot with butter and maple syrup.</p>
    <h2>How to make french toast</h2>
    <p>First you need to gather the ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>White bread</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Vanilla and cinnamon</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste &dash; it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.</p>
